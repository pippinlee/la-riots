        <p>Edward A. Travens, a 15-year-old white youth, was fatally shot Wednesday, April 29, 1992, near the intersection of San Fernando Road and Mission Boulevard in San Fernando. Travens was driving to a video store with his brother, Allen, 21, and a friend, Dan Ortiz. About 9:25 p.m., at the intersection of San Fernando Road and Mission Boulevard, they were approached by a man on foot. &#34;All they heard was &#39;Where you from?&#39; and &#39;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,&#39;&#34; said Travens&#39; uncle, Richard Ballasteros. Five bullets pierced Travens&#39; wiry body. Ortiz drove him to a hospital while Allen Travens cradled his brother in his arms. Eddie Travens died three hours later.</p>
