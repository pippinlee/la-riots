        <p>Cesar Aguilar, an 18-year-old Latino, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Westlake. Aguilar, a Honduran immigrant, was arrested with more than 40 other alleged looters near Sam&#39;s Corner Liquor Store at 6th Street and Westlake Avenue. Officers say he was ordered to lie prone, and that he then pulled what appeared to be a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward them. Officers fired at Aguilar with a 9-millimeter pistol and a shotgun. He was struck in the chest and died at the scene, according to an initial coroner&#39;s account. The &#34;gun,&#34; however, was a plastic toy with a black barrel and brown grips, officials said. Aguilar had lived for five months in the Park View Luxury Apartments, a $450-a-month hotel at MacArthur Park. Friends said he delivered newspapers for a living. A father of two, Aguilar had planned to return to Honduras to be reunited with his pregnant girlfriend. Aguilar&#39;s body was flown back to Honduras at that government&#39;s expense because Aguilar&#39;s family could not pay the $1,976, Consul General Rene Francisco Umana said. &#34;It&#39;s so sad,&#34; Umana said. &#34;Maybe he didn&#39;t have an idea to hurt anybody . . . but the situation was so difficult, so grave. In L.A., things can happen.&#34;</p>
