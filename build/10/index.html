            Jerel L. Channell, a 26 year old,
            Black male died on 1992-04-30
            in a death at Santa Monica Boulevard &amp; Seward Street in Hollywood.
        </h1>
        <p>Darnell R. Mallory, an 18-year-old black man, Jerel L. Channell, a 26-year-old black man, and Juanita Pettaway, a 37-year-old black woman, were killed in an auto accident Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Hollywood. The trio fled after Beverly Hills police officers noticed a defective taillight on their car and tried to stop them. After a high-speed chase down side streets, their car jumped a curb and crashed into a wall at Santa Monica Boulevard and Seward Street. An investigation showed that the three had robbed a man of his wallet in West Los Angeles. &#34;We have no reason to believe this was anything more than a common street robbery,&#34; said police. &#34;This is considered a riot case because of the riot-related robbery,&#34; the coroner&#39;s report says.</p>
